  time: 18:00-20:00
  venue: Arete Lobby, Ateneo de Manila University

    - "The Gangan Series Workshop Lab is an improviser-and-composer workshop which explores the potential of graphic scores and playing in medium-to-large ensembles. Graphic scores’ emphasis on alternative procedures allows more flexibility and possibilities yet retains or reconfigures certain compositional devices."

    - "Over the course of a week, participants will learn the history of graphic notation and undergo various exercises that will aid them in developing their own compositional strategies and notational systems which will culminate in a collaboratively-composed graphic score to be performed by selected festival musicians."

    - "Aside from the results of the week-long residency, the ensemble will perform two other scores: Tad Ermitaño’s “Malaganito 1.0” — a video score that only partially specifies and loosely suggests moods and rhythms — and another from Ignaz Schick, a Berlin-based experimental musician who specializes in free jazz and improvisation."

  venue: Hyundai Hall, Arete, Ateneo de Manila University

    - 'WSK concerts have always displayed the inclination towards redefining the limits of audiovisual performance. Synthesizing the visual with the sonic to form synesthetic displays, WSK events draw not only from live and expanded cinematic tradition but rather from a long lineage of photographic, performative, and experiential forms including the camera obscura, the panorama and diorama, the magic lantern, the color organ, liquid light shows and other theatrical formats.'

    - 'This special program will be split into two:'

    - 'The first half will present the collaborative result of an experimental film workshop conducted by Japanese artists Makino Takashi and Rei Hayama. In collaboration with WSK founder Tengal, live improvisational music and performances will augment and interact with the projected filmic output producing a highly sensorial event featuring the interplay of light, motion, bodies, and electronics.'

    - 'The second half will feature a completely new work from one of Manila’s earliest and most trailblazing experimental multimedia art groups: The Children of Cathode Ray. Established in 1989, three of the group’s original core members — Tad Ermitaño, Magyar Tuazon, and Jing Garcia — will perform. A Cathode Ray piece might have radios and 4-second cassette-tape loops feeding into a mix filled with drums and electronic percussion, effected guitars, synthesized pads, vintage gears and passionate raving in an invented language, which would in turn be augmented visually by video feedback, projections of exposed Super-8 abraded with a variety of kitchen implements, or VHS spliced on a pair of consumer VCRs. CCR created the sound of the future, yesterday.'

Just- created performance designs, circuits, code, and ideas will be put to the test in front of a live audience as a multidisciplinary group of creative performers share the work they've constructed over the course of the WSK festival week. Expect new work in live musical performance, movement, visuals, and surprises."

  date: Sunday, October 27
  venue: MRT-LRT1, Escolta
  desc:
    - '“Audio Tour,” a recurring project of music producer and artist escuri, is a soundwalk activity which encourages active listening among participants as they wander around specific locations as an alternative way of perceiving and relating to one’s environment. This iteration invites the audience to stroll through the historic street of Escolta in Manila. Designed to encourage an awareness of the omnipresence of sound, this program treats spaces as living organisms, each possessing their own unique character, communicating its stories through sound.'
    - 'Jett Ilagan, a.k.a. escuri, is a music producer, sound and visual artist from Laguna, Philippines. His audio works explore sound and particularly the idea of “cultural soundscapes” through various methods such as field recordings and personal encounters with the subject environment and its locals.'

  date: Sunday, October 27
  venue: Arroceros Forest Park
  desc:
    - 'PARADE is a sonic performance event that will take place at different parts of the Arroceros Forest Park. Three artists — mizutama, Kayu Nakada, and Tadashi Yonago — will invite the audience to position themselves anywhere within the park and to produce sound in any way they can, using whatever instrument they have on hand. FM transmitters and radios will be supplied by the artists to willing participants who may or may not use the devices in any way they see fit.'
    - 'All three artists share a DIY ethic, a fascination with electronics and aleatoric processes, and a tendency to find beauty in everyday life. These sensibilities are evident in this program which aims to activate the site as a sanctuary for ludic interactions.'

  artists:
    - Chaos Non Musica
    - Noisebath PH
  date: Sunday, October 27
  venue: Lawton Underpass
  desc:
    - "Two scenes collide in a notoriously dangerous underpass avoided by most pedestrians who would rather play real-life Frogger than risk getting mugged at knifepoint. Newly renovated, with its grime-caked tiled surfaces haphazardly scrubbed and its inhabitants dehumanized and evicted, the underpass is slowly regaining the trust of the commuters it terrified in the past."
    - "In this program, two communities — the Bali-based DIY noise festival Chaos Non Musica and Manila-based experimental collective Noisebath PH — square off to once again disrupt the area’s foot traffic and jolt passersby out of their 9-to-5 stupor with their careful selection of guttural growls and banshee screams, skull-drilling skronks and grating waves of static."
