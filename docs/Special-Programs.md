    - 'The results of the Gangan Series Workshop Lab will be performed along with other graphic scores.'

    - "The Gangan Series Workshop Lab is an improviser-and-composer workshop which explores the potential of graphic scores and playing in medium-to-large ensembles. Graphic scores, with its emphasis on alternative procedures, introduce many possibilities as they leave more room for the performers’ own interpretations while, despite circumventing the constraints classical notation, allowing composers to structure different sonic parameters (e.g. time, volume, pitch, instrumentation, sonority, etc.)"

    - "Over the course of a week, participants will learn the history of graphic notation and undergo various exercises that will aid them in developing their own compositional strategies and notational systems which will culminate in a collaboratively-composed graphic score to be performed by selected festival musicians."

    - "Aside from the workshop lab’s output, the ensemble will perform two other scores: Tad Ermitaño’s “Malaganito 1.0” — a video score that only partially specifies and loosely suggests moods and rhythms — and another from sound artist and curator Ignaz Schick."

    - 'WSK concerts have always displayed the inclination towards redefining the limits of audiovisual performance. Synthesizing the visual with the sonic to form synesthetic displays, WSK events draw not only from live and expanded cinematic tradition but rather from a long lineage of photographic, performative, and experiential forms including the camera obscura, the panorama and diorama, the magic lantern, the color organ, liquid light shows and other theatrical formats.'

    - 'This special program will be split into two:'

    - 'The first half will present the collaborative result of an experimental film workshop conducted by Japanese artists Makino Takashi and Rei Hayama. In collaboration with WSK founder Tengal, live improvisational music and performances will interact with the projected and highly sensorial filmic output.'

    - 'The second half will feature a completely new work from Manila’s iconoclastic and pioneering multimedia art groups since the 1980s: The Children of Cathode Ray.'
