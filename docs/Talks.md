  date: October 23-24

    - "The WSK Feedback Forum 2019  in collaboration with Nusasonic, takes a critical look at both historic and contemporary sound cultures particularly through issues of representation and discrepancies of power in worlds outside the West. Given the fascistic turn within and without the Southeast Asian region since the last edition of the forum, the idea that sound and music is also currency and power  — which can be harnessed to distract and/or pacify — is emphasized."

    - "The WSK Feedback Forum 2019 and its diverse topics are poised to spark more conversation and research, to un-map the region in order to challenge new geographies and connections, and to increase awareness of the ethical, aesthetic and political dimensions of sonic practices."

    - "OCT 23 – 13:30 - 15:00 : Balancing Equations: Networking with and within Asia and Africa, and the Spectre of Europe. "

    - "Featuring panelists that have worked in Asia, Africa and Europe, this panel compares the differences and similarities between experimental music and sound art scenes in these respective areas, as well as the representational and ethical implications of their promotion in Europe in the throes of political correctness and identity politics."

    - "OCT 23 – 15:30 - 17:00: Agree to Disagree (Gendered Forms, Institutional Sexisms)"

    - "This panel unpacks gendered artistic and musical expressions, institutional sexisms and racisms, as well as the tactics and networks we can tap to confront or circumvent them."

    - "OCT 24 – 13:30 - 15:00 : Jose Maceda and the Semiotics of Noise"

    - "Building on Tad Ermitano’s proposition, this panel examines composer and ethnomusicologist Jose Maceda’s practice and argues how noise and Filipino avant-garde art were co-opted and repurposed by the Marcosian state apparatus."

    - "OCT 24 – 15:30 - 17:00: If I Can't Dance to Your Revolution: New Dance Music from Southeast Asia."

    - "This panel traces the emergence and impact of grassroots dance music from the slums and borderlands of Southeast Asia, with a particular focus on Koplo from Java, Molam from Isan Province in the Thai-Laos border, and Budots from Mindanao and the Visayas."
