A night of dark dance tracks, pounding techno, grind/gabber/noise/dangdut glitched-out 3D animations."

  title: RAMBULAN SA LAWTON UNDERPASS
  artists:
    - Chaos Non Musica
    - Noisebath PH
  venue: Lawton Underpass
  desc:
    - "Two scenes collide in a notoriously dangerous underpass avoided by most pedestrians who would rather play real-life Frogger than risk getting mugged at knifepoint. Newly renovated, with its grime-caked tiled surfaces haphazardly scrubbed and its inhabitants dehumanized and evicted, the underpass is slowly regaining the trust of the commuters it terrified in the past. In this program, two communities — the Bali-based DIY noise festival Chaos Non Musica and Manila-based experimental collective Noisebath PH — square off to once again disrupt the area’s foot traffic and jolt passersby out of their 9-to-5 stupor with their careful selection of guttural growls and banshee screams, skull-drilling skronks and grating waves of static."
-
  title: 'SPECTRES'
  artists:
    - Datu Arellano
    - Laure Boer and collaborators
    - Erick Calilan
    - Meuko! Meuko! x NAXS corp.
  date: Sunday, October 27  
  time: 19:00-21:30
  venue: Rajah Sulayman Theater, Intramuros
  desc:
    - "Acting as the festival’s closing concert, SPECTRES will feature four electro-acoustic and multimedia acts, all of whom can be considered as artists working in the ambient idiom, or music which foregrounds transient textures over the rigid grids rhythm and structure imposes on sound. In an open-air theater located within the gates of a rebuilt Spanish colonial-era citadel, harmonically-rich and immersive walls of sound conjure remote atmospheres — of uncharted territories, otherworldly domains, and dystopian metropolises. Haunted by the weight of history, of centuries-long subjugation, and scarred with traces of the global catastrophe which almost obliterated it, the theater provides new dimensions to the readymade spaces often said to be evoked by ambient music."
