  desc:
    - 'Frenetic and buzzing particles congregate and form an amorphous mass, simultaneously dense and evanescent. Hovering over the present, this crowd is locked in the pulse, trailing every hypnotic beat, only to be further intoxicated by a flurry of sonic collages and grainy hyperkinetic visuals. In SWARM, WSK foregrounds experimental club music and some of its diverse inflections ranging from oneiric techno to retrofuturistic groove, and psychedelic noise to ambient industrial, through the works of five different performers unified by a synesthetic predilection for hazy textures and propulsive rhythms.'

  time: 22:00-02:00
  venue: Limbo  
  desc:
    - 'WSK and Noisebath PH collaborate once again to orchestrate TORTURE GARDEN, a purgatorial night of raw, visceral noise. Featuring artists from different parts of the Philippines and its neighboring territories, TORTURE GARDEN presents music as a coprophagic organism, unable to break away from a cycle of excretion and regurgitation. Equipped with contact mics, circuit-bent machines, and extended techniques, these artists — which include post-apocalyptic metal fetishists and a sleaze-and-schlock noisegrind outfit — scavenge from sonic refuse, dive neck-deep into music’s landfill, to unleash atonal and infernal torrents, test the thresholds of listeners, ultimately in pursuit of aural extremities.'

  date: Friday, October 25
  time: 22:00-00:00  
  venue: Ruins
  desc:
    - 'In the remains of a burned down ancestral house, abandoned until its recent repurposing, creaking floorboards and harsh echoes bouncing off thick concrete walls are swallowed by otherworldly tones, glacial glissandos, and atonal shrieks. They bleed into each other, ebbing and flowing, as eight musicians — of distinct backgrounds and divergent sensibilities — continue to speak in tongues, slip in and out of time, volume, and idioms, and divine phantasmic textures from electro-acoustic mediums. Lurking from different parts of the dilapidated space, this cracked and scattered octet emits crackling static and shimmering skronks, tone clusters and sound masses, as each musician follows their own psychic streams, communally taking part in this suburban disturbance.'

  desc:
    - 'Hive will be the locus of intersection for a variety of different hives, a site for exchange between independent bands and initiatives, a venue featuring performances by a number independent artists who work within the confines of the familiar yet are in continual pursuit of the new.'

  date: Sunday, October 27  
  time: 19:00-21:30
  venue: Rajah Sulayman Theater, Intramuros
  desc:
    - "Acting as the festival’s closing concert, SPECTRES will feature four electro-acoustic and multimedia acts, all of whom can be considered as artists working in the ambient idiom, or music which foregrounds transient textures over the rigid grids rhythm and structure imposes on sound. In an open-air theater located within the gates of a rebuilt Spanish colonial-era citadel, harmonically-rich and immersive walls of sound conjure remote atmospheres — of uncharted territories, otherworldly domains, and dystopian metropolises. Haunted by the weight of history, of centuries-long subjugation, and scarred with traces of the global catastrophe which almost obliterated it, the theater provides new dimensions to the readymade spaces often said to be evoked by ambient music."
