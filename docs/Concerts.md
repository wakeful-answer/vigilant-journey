  title: FREE IMPROV NIGHT
  date: Friday, October 25
  time: 22:00-00:00
  venue: will be announced soon
  desc: The idea of free form, free associative, free improvisation seems unwieldly and bound to entangle itself in the unrecognizable, yet there is order that emerges from what appears to be chaotic, an imagined unity urged into motion by the collaboration of fragmented objects that interact and intertwine, of sounds that work for and against each other, formlessness that begins to resemble form. Collaboration yields a communal totality, spontaneously configured by consonance and dissonance as events unfold in time.
