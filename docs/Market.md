AFK: PRINT AND ZINE FAIR
Saturday, October 27
11AM - 8:00PM
Loggia, Casa Manila, Intramuros

Kwago, Comma and WSK organize a print and zine fair to gather printmakers, authors, artists, hackers, and musicians in one place to celebrate print, art and the DIY movement.

Slang for the acronym "Away From Keyboard," AFK is often used to tell a person online that you will leave the computer to do something in the physical realm. AFK is an invitation to be present and to enjoy the intimacy of DIWO (Doing it with Others).
