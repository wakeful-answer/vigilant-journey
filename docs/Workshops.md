    - "This three-day workshop, to be conducted by experimental filmmakers Makino Takashi and Rei Hayami, aims to maximize the participants’ senses of sight and hearing and to help them develop a propensity for improvisation through various cameraless filmmaking techniques and a brief exploration of expanded cinema."
    - "Throughout the workshop, a series of lectures and exercises pertaining to soundscape visualization, collage-making in the context of film production, stereoscopy, and live performance. Participants will learn how to creatively render natural acoustic phenomena via pen and paper, to apply 3D stereoscopy to film, to manipulate 16mm film — both image and sound — using different materials and techniques, and ultimately, to work with different media and concepts, translating information through a series of artistic processes."
    - "The collaborative result of this workshop will be presented as part of a synesthetic audiovisual performance wherein live improvisation and music will interact with the projected filmic output. By exploring filmmaking without the use of a camera or editing software, the workshop foregrounds the materiality of film, the tactility of image and sound, and the intertwining of senses."

    - 'The workshop will begin by examining how non-musical sound captivated artists and
      composers alike at different moments over the last 100 years, from Luigi Russolo’s pre-World
      War II intonarumori to musique concrète in the 60s-70s, and from the incorporation of "field
      recordings” in modern music production to the creative manipulation of “noise” in
      contemporary sound design.'
    - 'The workshop will then proceed with a hands-on exploration of DIY culture at the crossroads of
      engineering and sound design via a simple circuit assembly and soldering exercise, wherein the
      participants will work in separate groups as they customize specially-made “soundtables” or
      tabletop modular structures, equipped with contact microphones, onto which the participants
      can select and fit a variety of materials such as metal springs and wooden objects. The groups
      will undergo three video-scoring exercises to acquaint them with the sonic properties of their
      electro-acoustic soundtables. This will aid them in their final group performance wherein they
      will follow a video graphic score suggesting rhythms, dynamics, and texture.
      The WSK Soundtable Workshop will be conducted by Lawrence Ang and Marco Ortiga.'
