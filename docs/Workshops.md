    - "This three-day workshop, to be conducted by experimental filmmakers Makino Takashi and Rei Hayami, aims to maximize the participants’ senses of sight and hearing and to help them develop a propensity for improvisation through various cameraless filmmaking techniques and a brief exploration of expanded cinema."
    - "Throughout the workshop, a series of lectures and exercises pertaining to soundscape visualization, collage-making in the context of film production, stereoscopy, and live performance. Participants will learn how to creatively render natural acoustic phenomena via pen and paper, to apply 3D stereoscopy to film, to manipulate 16mm film — both image and sound — using different materials and techniques, and ultimately, to work with different media and concepts, translating information through a series of artistic processes."
    - "The collaborative result of this workshop will be presented as part of a synesthetic audiovisual performance wherein live improvisation and music will interact with the projected filmic output. By exploring filmmaking without the use of a camera or editing software, the workshop foregrounds the materiality of film, the tactility of image and sound, and the intertwining of senses."
