**FREE IMPROV NIGHT**  
Friday, October 25  
22:00-00:00  
Ruins  

The idea of free form, free associative, free improvisation seems unwieldly and bound to entangle itself in the unrecognizable, yet there is order that emerges from what appears to be chaotic, an imagined unity urged into motion by the collaboration of fragmented objects that interact and intertwine, of sounds that work for and against each other, formlessness that begins to resemble form. Collaboration yields a communal totality, spontaneously configured by consonance and dissonance as events unfold in time.

**WSK x ELEPHANT**  
Friday, October 25  
22:00-03:00

Elephant is a celebration of Manila’s rave culture, a scene that disregards gender norms and sexual orientations, a party where the colorful and the outrageous collide in a space that proudly welcomes it.
