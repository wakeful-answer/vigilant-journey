**WSK** is celebrating its 10th Year Edition of the festival and the festival contemplates itself in the context of sound, media and contemporary art histories in Philippines. This edition presents the overview of the intersections of art and technology in Manila and the reasons, issues and challenges the platform has faced in its decade of existence through a variety of programs.

Through a new joint programme developed with **NUSASONIC**, a multi-year project that plunges into a broad spectrum of experimental sound and music cultures in Southeast Asia, enabling dialogue within the region, with Europe, and beyond. Beginning as a multi-day lab where new artist pairings, a hacklab, and an open art science projects play together and create new musical and visual works, ideas, and possibilities. The festival showcases the results of these works within a programme that also includes concerts, club nights, guerrilla outdoor events, and daytime programme of exhibitions, film screenings, talks, panels, and workshops.
**WSK X** is supported by The Japan Foundation Asia Center Grant Program for Promotion of Cultural Collaboration and **NUSASONIC** platform.
