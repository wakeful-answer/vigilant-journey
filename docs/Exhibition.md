    - 'Arranged in a grid within the exhibition space are 49 spiral columns of copper wire. Each visitor will be given a small device which can play a sine wave, considered to be the most elemental sound containing neither overtone nor noise. They will be allowed to select the sine wave’s frequency and decide the column on which to attach the device.
    These sine waves will remain audible for the rest of the exhibition period which means that the sound field, from absolute silence, would get increasingly complex throughout the exhibition’s duration as more visitors contribute to the installation.'
    - 'Aside from being a collective performance, “stay” by The Sine Wave Orchestra is also a musical work that is perpetually changing, its character wholly contingent on variables such as the number of devices, their settings and locations, as well as the listener’s position.
    The SINE WAVE ORCHESTRA (SWO) was launched in 2002 by Ken Furudate, Kazuhiro Jo, Daisuke Ishida, and Mizuki Noguchi as a project that works exclusively with sine waves.'
