<h1>Crossing Aural Geographies</h1>

**Nusasonic** takes its title from _“Nusantara,”_ an ancient Javanese term which is nowadays used to address the multiple connections between Southeast Asian countries. **Nusasonic** incorporates a vast range of formats such as artistic labs, commissioned works, concerts, installations, festivals, lectures, publications and more to look at how contemporary sound practices enable connections within the Southeast Asian region and with Europe, all while paying critical attention to local contexts and ongoing global asymmetries. In addition to presenting outstanding artistic voices to the public, the initiative aims to support artists in their practice, to strengthen local networks, to encourage cross-border and inter-cultural cooperation, and to contribute to broadening the understanding of contemporary sound practices.

**Nusasonic – Crossing Aural Geographies** is an initiative of Goethe-Institut Southeast Asia and is a collaboration between CTM Festival (Berlin), Yes No Klub (Yogyakarta), Playfreely/BlackKaji (Singapore), and WSK Festival for the Recently Possible (Manila). The project kicked-off with a two-week-long Artistic Lab and Festival in Yogyakarta in October 2018.
